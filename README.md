## Overview of the analysis
For this project we are required to derive the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. We will be determining the summary statistics for June and December.

## Results
1. The first step I took to derive the results was retreiving the precipitation and displaying it through a bar chart. Following is the last 12 months of temperature observation data

2. We also ran a query to derive the list of most active stations and their count in descending order for better understanding.

3. For comparing the data for the month of June and December the summary statistics is displayed in form of dataframes. Following are the summary statistics for the month of June and December:

4. If we see the above summary statistics for June and December we see the following difference in the data:
   - The Average temperature for June (74.9) is higher than that of December (71).
   - There is also major difference in the minimum temperature between June (64) and December(56).
   - The count of measurements for June (1700) if higher than that of December (1517).

## Summary

For the purpose of running two additional queries I went ahead and calculate the precipation data for the last 12 months for June and December.
Following is the last 12 months of precipitation data result

The precipitation is a bit higher in December than in June. From looking at the data it appears that it rains more in December which would not be suitable month for surfing. The data also shows that december month is cooler than June, but this could result in less business for icecream and surfing.
